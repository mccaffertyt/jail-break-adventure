Jail Break - Adventure on the Island of Adventure

Jail Break is an adventure set in my sandbox module The Island Adventure.

It is a DnD5e adventure with no levels set for the NPCs, so the DM can determine as they see fit what challenge they want to set the party.

A robbery and murder has been committed by a well meaning local hero standing up for the rights of farmers. He is being held in The Keep prison
and is awaiting the hangmans noose.

Cartwright the grocer knows the victim and has been contacted by the farmers who have promised to pay for the hire of adventurers 
to free the hero and see justice done.

The island is a place for adventure based on my own D&D campaign centered around the D&D module series B - The search for adventure.

The adventure portraits, tokens, text and maps have been produced by Tom McCafferty using Paint Dot Net, Dungeondraft and Unreal Engine which
allow commercial use of content created with them

Some references have been made to the Foundry VTT DnD5e Game System so no art work or tokens is included. These artwork file references have been included in the packaging of the adventure to indicate the monsters and items the DM should use. This art work is provided by Fantasy Art and the FA -Â  Fan-Content License seems to 
indicate that it is okay to deploy references these tokens.
